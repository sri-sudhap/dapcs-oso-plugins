# Offline Signing Orchestrator - Plugins
This repository contains plugins used to integrate third-party systems with the Offline Signing Orchestrator (OSO). Plugin directories located at the project root are used to build a Docker image that is included in an HPVS contract. This image must be pushed to a private Docker container registry accessible to all OSO LPARs. The Terraform scripts used to generate the HPVS contracts provided to OSO are located in the /contracts directory.
